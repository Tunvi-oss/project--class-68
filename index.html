        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Shamroke is an international school . The schools principal is Ms. Chetan Bansal.TEACHERS CAN PAINT THE CANVAS OF FUTURE

We are teachers. We are friends, Philosophers, guides. We have been tasked with building lives and making future brighter. The destiny of the country lies in our hands. Let us ask ourselves are we doing our duty?

Twenty first century classroom is different than ours. Are we future ready? Chalk and talk method is out of date. There should be more emphasis on practices and real life time situations. For that we need to come up with a more expressive way of teaching. Multimedia is a useful tool. Digital technologies in the classroom must go hand in hand with innovative teaching to have a true impact on educational achievements. Innovative practices in teaching ensure better learning outcomes for our students.

We should act as a change agent. A little change in the way we teach makes us learning experts instead of teachers. As john Haiti rightly said,’ My fundamental task is to evaluate the effect of my teaching on students’ learning and achievement. The success and failure of my students’ learning is about what I do or don’t do. I am a change agent.”

It is a well known fact that we see ourselves through the eyes of others. The self conception and mental health of a student is formed according to the ways of their teachers and classmates react to them with affection, rejection or with respect. If teachers behave in a respectful and concerned manner with their students, they show respect and concerns for others. These are the basic milestones of sound mental health.

The classroom environment plays a vital role in awakening natural curiosity and inborn motivation to learn and excel in all the activities. The foremost duty of a teacher is to awaken the love for learning in the students. Teacher is not a person holding a torch and guiding the path towards better future, he should be the torch himself. Students generally keep a watch on teacher’s life. So, a teacher has to maintain a good set of manners and try to be a role model.

This implies that one should play the role of a teacher with dedication, honesty, affection and patience. He/she should have every technique to take care of not only intelligent students but back benchers too. I firmly believe that teachers with the help of parents can give a better generation to the country. Education should be measured by how many lives it has transformed, how many ideas have been raised and how many new discoveries have been made. It is possible only with commitment from all the stakeholders of the school. They should share decision making, they should have common vision. Collaboration and the establishment of the support structures should be there for teachers.
